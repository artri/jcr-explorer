				<p>
					Due to JSF implementation conflicts between the Sun
					Reference Implementation (that is shipped with Sun
					servers) and MyFaces (which is used for development
					and bundled with JCR-Explorer at the moment) the
					JCR-Explorer does not run in these servers. We are
					working on this bug, although we didn't solve it yet
					:-( Stay tuned!
				</p>
				<p>
					If you wish to run JCR-Explorer in these server
					please feel free to let us know. The more feedback
					we get, the higher the priority will be to solve it!
					Or if you have some tips on how to solve this issue,
					please let us know, too!
