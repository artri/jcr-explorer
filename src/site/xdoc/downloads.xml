		<section name="JBoss-bundled Jumpstart Version">
			<p>
				We are currently putting a Jumpstart version together,
				that is basically a JBoss AS bundled with a
				pre-configured Jackrabbit and the newest JCR-Explorer.
				Although it's not meant for production use, we made the
				experience that it's pretty nice to check out JCR. Stay
				tuned for that or contact us if you're interested in
				it...
