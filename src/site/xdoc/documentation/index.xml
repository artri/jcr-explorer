		<section name="Getting Started with JCR Web-Explorer">
			<p>
				First you need to have a JCR repository running. The
				Explorer then expects you to have this repository
				available via JNDI. Then you need a version of the
				JCR-Explorer to deploy into your container. If you are
				at that point, access it via
				http://localhost:8080/jcr-explorer/login.jsf and use
				your JNDI name to log in.

			<subsection name="Build from sources">
				<p>
					Either check-out the latest sources (tagged version
					or snapshot) from the SVN repository or download the
					latest release of the sources. Then just build the
					WAR by executing 'mvn package' from the command
					line.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Use a binary release">
				<p>
					Binary release contain a file jcr-explorer.war,
					which can just be deployed into your container.
				</p>
				<p>
					Be aware that these releases include bundled
					libraries. Depending on your environment you could
					wish to not have some the libraries included. Either
					remove them by hand from the WAR file (e.g. WinRAR
					can open the WAR file and allows you to remove
					single files manually) or try to build your own WAR
					file from the sources. In that case you can toggle
					including of the files by changing the scope of the
					relevant dependencies in the pom.xml to 'provided'.
